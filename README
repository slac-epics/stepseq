How to use the stepseq module:
    - In the app/src/Makefile, include stepseq.dbd in your app_DBD and
      stepseq in your app_LIBS.
    - In configure/RULES, add the line:
      	 include $(STEPSEQ)/configure/RULES.dbs
    - In any script using python, put "${STEPSEQ}/python" on PYTHONPATH to
      get access to sequtils.py.
